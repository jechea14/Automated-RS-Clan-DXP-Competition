# Automated-RS-Clan-DXP-Competition

1. Clanmates split into brackets based on total levels before DXP (Bracket A: <2k total, Bracket B: 2k-2.5k total, Bracket C: 2.5k-2.7k total, Bracket D: 2.7k+ total).
2. Show results of most DXP gained to least DXP gained in each bracket (Web scrape RuneClan).
3. Rules applied and no rules applied versions.

### Rules

- Summoning, Herblore, and Farming xp count as half.
- Runecrafting, Arch, Agility, Hunter, Div, Smithing, Fishing, Mining, and Woodcutting xp count as double.
- Rest of the skills count as normal.

## Purpose of this project

- Create a fair competition among the lower and higher level players, so the lower level players can compete against other low level players and vise versa.
- Originally, the competition winners would be the top 5 most dxp gained. However, several clan mates brought up the unfairness of this as higher level clan mates would easily get top placements.
- Automate the manual tasks of calculating the rules applied and placing results into respective brackets.
